# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction — Interncred Task 1

This project explores survival prediction using a synthetic Titanic dataset as part of my data science internship at Interncred.

## 🔍 Objective
Predict passenger survival using features like age, fare, and family size. Evaluate multiple models and explain results clearly.

## 📊 Models Tested
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Logistic Regression

## 📈 Key Insights
- Most predictive features: **Fare**, **Age**, **FamilySize**
- Best model accuracy: **52%** using Gradient Boosting
- Feature importance and model comparisons used to explain performance

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to clean and encode categorical data
- How to evaluate model performance beyond accuracy
- How to interpret feature importance and diagnose weak signals
